VLFBERHT swords: Origin, material, and manufacture
Ingo Petri

Abstract
VLFBERHT or ULFBERHT is the most frequent inscription on Viking Age sword blades. The majority of these swords have been found in Scandinavia, much less in the Frankish Empire so that it might seem that they have been produced in Scandinavia. But this is most probably a result of different burial customs. The blades were most probably produced in the Frankish Empire and came to Scandinavia as loot or ransom.The signature has been interpreted as the name of the sword smith. But recently, it has been shown that the person behind this name rather was an overseer over the sword production who had position in ecclesiastical or monastic hierarchy. The reverse side of the blades show geometrical marks. These may have developed from the Pagan serpent or worm symbolism connected to swords.The patterns may have survived into Christian times, but with a changed symbolic meaning. It has always been tried to distinguish between original VLFBERHT blades and imitations or falsifications. Recently, metallographic analyses have shown a correlation between special inscription variants
and different methods of manufacture.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Swords with inlays, especially with inscriptions stand out from the mass of swords and thus have always drawn attention.Among these names, the inscription VLFBERHT is the most frequent on Viking Age swords. That is why they are the best analysed and most comprehensively published form of inlay (Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 90; Stalsberg, 2008b, p. 1).
The first scientific study of VLFBERHT swords has been published by Lorange (1889), several more followed (see Geibig, 1991, p. 116). The youngest study has been published by Stalsberg (2008a, 2008b), she established the first typology of signatures and reverse marks and analysed their chronological and geographical distribution.
The main question has always been the meaning of the inscription, which has been mostly interpreted as the name of the sword smith. The authors tried to find the person behind that name and to locate his workshop as well as to distinguish between original blades and imitations or falsifications.
The exact number of extant VLFBERHT blades is not known, every time archaeologists have searched for them in collections, new ones were found. For her study, Stalsberg was able to collect information about 166 VLFBERHT blades from 23 European countries, but since then, she has learned about a few more (Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 90;Stalsberg, 2008b, pp. 1–2, 11).

2 | CHRONOLOGY
There is only one serviceable typology of early mediaeval sword blades, published by Geibig (1991, pp. 83–90,150–154, figure 40).VLFBERHT inscriptions only occur on two of Geibig's blade types—Types 2 and 3 (Geibig,1991, p. 126). They date from the middle of the eighth to the first half of the 10th, respectively, the end of the eighth to the second half or end of the 10th century (Geibig,1991, p. 153, figure 40). So this gives a date range for the production of VLFBERHT blades but does not allow for a more precise analyses of variations of inscriptions or marks on the reverse side of the blades (Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 97; Stalsberg, 2008b, p. 8).However, the handles may be dated more precisely. But there is a possibility that handles and blades are not contemporary, as old blades might have been remounted with new handles, or old handles might have been used on new blades (Geibig, 1991, pp. 152–153; Petri,2017, pp. 139, 172; Stalsberg, 2008a, pp. 97–98; Stalsberg, 2008b, p. 8). VLFBERHT blades are equipped with handle types that date from around 800 AD to the 11th century, maybe even the 12th century. So VLFBERHT blades were produced from around 800 to the second half or end of the 10th century, and they stayed in use to the 11th century(Geibig, 1991, pp. 154–156; Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 98; Stalsberg, 2008b, p. 8, figure 41).

3 | GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
Most VLFBERHT swords have been found in Scandinavia—especially in Norway—and in the Baltic States and Old Rus while there are very few from the Frankish Empire and England (Figure 1). Usually, this distribution would lead to the interpretation that these blades have been produced where most of them have been found. And recently, it has actually been interpreted this way (Feuerbach & Hanley, 2016, p. 77; Williams, 2012, pp. 61–62, 117.). But as has been pointed out by earlier authors, several arguments speak against this straightforward interpretation. The biggest part of the blades found in Scandinavia, the Baltic States, and Old Rus come from graves, while the blades from the Frankish Empire and England almost all come from rivers. This is simply a consequence of religion: Scandinavia,the Baltic States, and Old Rus were Pagan for most of the time under consideration and graves were equipped with gravegoods, among others with swords—Norway had especially generous burials rites. The Frankish Empire and England were Christian countries where gravegoods where not given. The interpretation that religion is the main reason for the geographical distribution is supported by the fact that it changes in the Late Viking Age, with slightly more blades from the former Frankish Empire and much less from Scandinavia, the Baltic States, and Old Rus. During the late Viking Age, most of previously Pagan Europe was Christianised, which means that grave goods were no longer given into the graves. None of the Norwegian finds dates later than early—middle 11th century, which coincides with the end of Pagan burial rites here (Müller‐Wille, 1970, pp. 70–72, 75; Stalsberg, 2008a, pp. 98, 100, maps 1–4;Stalsberg, 2008b, pp. 8–15, maps 1–4).

But how did the blades get to for example Scandinavia? Generally, it is assumed that the blades or complete swords were exported from the Frankish Empire. This is based on prohibitions in the Carolingian capitularia to sell weapons to foreigners—they are taken as evidence that in fact such trade did take place. Stalsberg (Stalsberg,2008a, pp. 107–108; Stalsberg, 2008b, pp. 21–23) re‐examined the capitularia and came to the conclusion, that these sources do certainly not support the idea of a considerable export of weapons to Scandinavia. She rather assumes that the VLFBERHT blades got there as loot or ransom. This is supported by the fact that there are no indications for intensive trade connections between Scandinavia and the Frankish/German Empire before around 1000 AD (Kluge, 2000, p. 194; compare also: Feuerbach & Hanley, 2016, p. 76).

4 | SIGNATURES AND REVERSE MARKS

Most VLFBERHT blades show the eponymous inscription on one and a geometrical mark on the reverse side. These inlays are made from pattern welded iron wire that has been welded into a not pattern welded blade. They are located in the fuller in the upper third of the blade, the inscription reads from the handle towards the point. The inscriptions and marks are not identical on all blades. Different marks occur as well as different spellings of the signature,spanning from little variations to completely misspelled inscriptions that bear only a far resemblance to the supposed originals (Geibig, 1991, pp. 116, 120; Oakeshott, 1991, p. 5; Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 95; Stalsberg, 2008b, p. 6).
In her typology of signatures and reverse marks, Stalsberg lists six variants of both signatures and reverse marks (Figure 2). But there are only two main variants of VLFBERHT signatures, the only difference between them being the location of the second cross, namely,variant 1 which is written +VLFBERH+T and variant 2 which is written +VLFBERHT+. The reverse marks have three main variants, whereof variant V is simpler and often less precisely made (Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 96, figure 1; Stalsberg, 2008b, pp. 6–7, figure 2).

FIGURE 2 Stalsberg's typology of variants of VLFBERHT signatures and reverse marks. In brackets: the number of blades (Stalsberg, 2008a, figure 1)

Blades with all variants of signatures and reverse marks were in use throughout the whole Viking Age.It is unclear if all these variants were produced during the entire period or if the blades were in use for a long time and eventually equipped with new handles. But there is certain tendency that signatures of variant 1 are slightly younger than those of variant 2 (Stalsberg, 2008a, pp. 98, 102, table 2; Stalsberg, 2008b, pp. 10,19, figure 4).

The geographical distribution of the different variants and of their combinations seems to show the same pattern as the general distribution of VLFBERHT blades (Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 100; Stalsberg, 2008b, p. 15).

4.1 | Meaning and provenance of signatures

The signatures are “written” in Latin letters. These letters have a distinct shape that according to the epigraphist Kloos (1970, pp. 90–91) points to the transition period from Merowingian letters to those of the Carolingian Renaissance, so it may be dated in the period between the second half of the eighth and the early ninth century.The name Ulfberht itself is a male personal name, also of Frankish origin. It occurs in different spellings in contemporary documents (Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 101; Stalsberg, 2008b, pp. 16–17). The spellings of the two components of the name, Vlf‐/Ulf‐ (both spellings are pronounced Wulf‐ or Wolf‐ for English speakers) and ‐berht do not show the same geographical distribution. While Vlf‐/Ulf‐ is found in Langobardic and West Frankish sources, ‐berht occurs in Old Saxon documents. However, onomast Müller (1970, p. 91) located its origin most probably in the Lower Frankish Area, as the spelling Vlf‐/Ulf‐ does occasionally occur here.

But who was Ulfberht? It is improbable that he was the smith who forged the blades because his signature shows that he was literate. It is more likely that he was an overseer over the sword production and that the work at the anvil was done by illiterate slaves (Stalsberg, 2008a, pp. 101, 106; Stalsberg, 2008b, pp. 18, 20). Stalsberg(Stalsberg, 2008a, pp. 101–103; Stalsberg, 2008b, pp. 18–20) pointed out that the crosses that are placed in front of and at or close to the end of the majority of signatures might indicate a position in ecclesiastical or monastic hierarchy. There are three groups of persons whose signatures had and have an initial cross: Roman Catholic abbots, bishops, and monasteries. In our case, monasteries can be excluded, since Ulfberht is not a place name.Bishops and abbots were warlords who waged war, and weapons were produced at the episcopal seats and in abbeys (Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 102;Stalsberg, 2008b, p. 19). Contemporary documents contain names with crosses and also crosses that function as an invocation. But so far no signatures with a second cross are known. Ulfberht was not necessarily a bishop or an abbot, but he might have had another position in ecclesiastical or monastic hierarchy.

A different interpretation is presented by Feuerbach and Hanley (Feuerbach & Hanley, 2016, pp. 77–80). They suggest that +VLFBERH+T is an invocation with religious connotations and that the blades were commissioned by the Norwegian King Haakon the Good and have been made in Norway. Marek (Marek, 2004, pp. 44–46; Marek,2005, pp. 49–50) considers the inscription to be a Scandinavian Kenning for “the sword which the warrior ULF has the right to bear (or bears).”1 Both interpretations do not explain the fact that the inscriptions have been carried out in letters from the transition period from Merowingian to those of the Carolingian Renaissance and contain Christian crosses as early as the beginning of the ninth century. Furthermore, it would be too big a coincidence that a Scandinavian religious invocation or kenning at the same time is a contemporary Frankish male name.

The fact that VLFBERHT blades were inscribed suggests that they were something special and were worth being marked—maybe for their outstanding quality. So it might be assumed that some of the VLFBERHT blades are imitations or falsifications making use of the good reputation of the originals. The different variants of signatures and reverse marks have always been regarded as indication for imitations or falsifications, especially when the inscription is more or less misspelled (Geibig, 1991, pp. 118, 121–122; Marek, 2004, p. 46; Marek, 2005, p. 50; Müller‐Wille,1970, p. 76; Stalsberg, 2008a, pp. 89–90, 95; Stalsberg, 2008b, pp. 1, 5). But Stalsberg (Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 106;Stalsberg, 2008b, pp. 20–21) pointed out that misspelt signatures cannot straight away be regarded as imitations or falsifications, because the slaves producing the inscription were illiterate. Furthermore, it has to be added that little mistakes can simply happen and after the inscription has been welded into the blade it cannot be changed anymore. So if single letters are missing, doubled, upside down, mirrored, incomplete, or standing at the wrong place, this is not necessarily a proof for a falsification. However, bigger mistakes are unlikely to happen in the original workshop.

Geibig (Geibig, 1991, pp. 118–120, figure 32) used a metric approach to differentiate between originals and copies.On the basis of 13 VLFBERHT inscriptions found in Western Germany and the Netherlands, he determined the variation range of 14.0–19.8 cm for the lengths and 1.9–2.7 cm for heights of inscriptions that are most probably originals. When he compared this to all the VLFBERHT inscriptions with known measurements, about half of them lay outside the variation range. Geibig himself takes this approach only as rudimentary. Good copies may lie within the variation range whereas originals with missing or doubled letters may lie outside. Another problem for the differentiation between original inscriptions and imitations or falsifications on the basis of misspellings or measurements is their visibility. Many of the inlays are fragmented or covered by corrosion. For several of them different readings have been published (Androshchuk, 2003, pp. 24–25; Geibig, 1991, p. 123; Müller‐Wille, 1970, p. 76, note 60; Petri,2017, p. 157; Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 100; Stalsberg, 2008b, p. 15), so an alleged misspelling might simply be the result of a wrong reading.

4.2 | Meaning of reverse marks

The same marks characteristic for VLFBERHT blades also occur on blades with other or without inscriptions, among other marks that are not characteristic for VLFBERHT blades. Among those that are characteristic, the simplest variant—variant V—is the most frequent.Interestingly, blades with marks characteristic for VLFBERHT blades but without an VLFBERHT inscription have so far only been found in Scandinavia and Old Rus (Geibig, 1991, p. 114;Müller‐Wille, 1970, pp. 81–82; Stalsberg, 2008a, pp. 90, 104–105; Stalsberg, 2008b, pp. 2, 20).

The majority of reverse marks characteristic for VLFBERHT blades consists of groups of vertical bars with a pattern composed of lozenges and St Andrew's crosses between them (Geibig, 1991, pp. 114, 119; Müller‐Wille, 1970,p. 76). They show a more or less standardised shape so they probably had a special meaning. They have mostly been interpreted as manufacturer's brand and thus as an indication for different workshops. Stalsberg suggests that they may also indicate the quality of the blades or the group of Persons, for whom the blades were destined for (Geibig,1991, pp. 114–123; Müller‐Wille, 1970, p. 81; Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 103; Stalsberg, 2008b, p. 20). 

The author of the article at hand proposed that they rather had a symbolic meaning. Lehmann (2017, pp. 277–279) proposes a relation between most of the blade inlays and the Pagan serpent or worm symbolism connected to swords.He also points out that the marks on early mediaeval swords are very simple and strongly stylised shapes. Included in his interpretation are horseshoe‐ or omega‐shaped inlays that also occur twice on the reverse side of VLFBERHT blades,they are included in Stalsberg's variant VI (Stalsberg, 2008a, figure 1;Stalsberg, 2008b, figure 2; see also Geibig,1991, pp. 114, 119; Müller‐Wille, 1970, figures 8.78, 9.88). Lehmann (2017, p. 285) assumes further, that in Carolingian Times the Christian Religion got less tolerant towards Pagan symbols, resulting in a disappearance of serpent or worm symbolism. But looking closer to the reverse marks on VLFBERHT blades, the pattern in the centre of Stalsberg's variant V marks could represent a highly stylised version of the middle part of the snakes that are carved onto scabbards from the Roman Iron Age and Migration Period that have been found in Northern Europe, particularly those from Nydam(Lehmann, 2017, p. 275, figure 1; Rau, 2010, figure 117.1). These carvings and the reverse marks are even located roughly in the same position, in the upper third of the scabbard respectively blade.

He also points out that the marks on early mediaeval swords are very simple and strongly stylised shapes. Included in his interpretation are horseshoe‐ or omega‐shaped inlays that also occur twice on the reverse side of VLFBERHT blades,they are included in Stalsberg's variant VI (Stalsberg, 2008a, figure 1; Stalsberg, 2008b, figure 2; see also Geibig,1991, pp. 114, 119; Müller‐Wille, 1970, figures 8.78, 9.88). Lehmann (2017, p. 285) assumes further, that in Carolingian Times the Christian Religion got less tolerant towards Pagan symbols, resulting in a disappearance of serpent or worm symbolism. But looking closer to the reverse marks on VLFBERHT blades, the pattern in the centre of Stalsberg's variant V marks could represent a highly stylised version of the middle part of the snakes that are carved onto scabbards from the Roman Iron Age and Migration Period that have been found in Northern Europe, particularly those from Nydam(Lehmann, 2017, p. 275, figure 1; Rau, 2010, figure 117.1). These carvings and the reverse marks are even located roughly in the same position, in the upper third of the scabbard respectively blade.

Depictions of contemporary scabbards often show bindings that are composed of vertical lines and St Andrew's crosses (Geibig, 1991, p. 111, figure 29) that bear a certain resemblance to Stalsberg's variant V marks. Notker Balbulus in his Gesta Karoli Magni describes Charlemagne's scabbard. He mentions little projecting crosses on its outside that should make the sword “durable for the destruction of the Pagan.”2 If he refers to the mentioned crossshaped bindings his explanation may also be true for at least the reverse marks of Stalsberg s variant V.

Even both ways of explanation might be the case: the Pagan snake symbolism might have survived into Christian times, but with a changed symbolic meaning.

Feuerbach and Hanley (2016, p. 79) state that the reverse marks are runic inscriptions. This seems quite unlikely,as runic inscriptions are hitherto unknown on sword blades and as the marks do not show any reasonable runic sequences.

5 | BLADES: MATERIAL, MANUFACTURE, AND QUALITY

Geibig (1991, pp. 118, 121) and Stalsberg (Stalsberg, 2008a, pp. 89–90, 96, 106; Stalsberg, 2008b, pp. 1, 7, 21) consider metallurgical investigations of the manufacturing technique and blade quality to be the best way to distinguish between originals and imitations or falsifications. This may be true, even if the results have to treated with care, as Oakeshott (1991, p. 6) points out that falsifications do not necessarily have to be of a lower quality.

This approach has been taken by Williams who published metallographic analyses of 56 sword blades from the early mediaeval period, most of them bearing an VLFBERHT inscription. On the basis of these analyses, he divides the swords into five groups (Williams, 2012, pp. 117–122, 231).3 

Group I contains swords made entirely of slag‐poor steel with a carbon content >0.8%, and group II swords are made entirely of slag‐poor steel with a carbon content of 0.8%. Group III consists of swords that have a hardened steel edge with a carbon content of 0.4% and an iron core, in group IV the steel edges are unhardened. Finally, group V contains swords made entirely of iron.

Interestingly, there is a correlation between his blade groups and the spelling of the signature. Groups I and II contain almost exclusively swords, which show Stalsberg's inscription variant 1, while nearly all swords with Stalsberg's inscription variant 2 are in Williams' group III. This group also contains some swords with misspelled inscriptions. The degree of misspelling then increases further via Groups IV to V.4

Williams attests that the swords of the first two groups were of the highest quality available at this time and that the quality then successively lessens up to group V (Williams, 2012, p. 120). He therefore assumes that the swords in these first two groups are the originals, while the other three groups contain the imitations or falsifications. However,this contradicts the results of Stalsberg, who recognises a certain tendency that signature variant 2 is slightly older than variant 1. This is also supported by the more reasonable spelling of the name. According to this, the swords in Williams Group III would be the originals, and the swords in groups I and II would be imitations or further developments.

Looking closer at the metallographic analyses published by him, also “the highest quality available at this time” for the swords in groups I and II cannot be confirmed. Five blades out of nine in group I5 and one from group II6 show cementite networks at the grain boundaries leading to a rather brittle blade, while one from group I7 has been “somewhat overheated in working,” thus being relatively soft. If the distribution of the average edge hardness in his groups is compared (Figure 3), one can clearly see that groups I–III slightly differ in hardness: group II is the softest, group I is slightly harder, and group III is the hardest. So swords from group III might be the better ones, because they possess a hard edge whose brittleness is compensated by a soft but tough core.

Williams argues that an iron core is not very useful because bloomery iron contains too large an amount of slag,thus being not tough but brittle (Williams, 2012, pp. 65, 202). But high amounts of slag in the iron are not exclusively a question of the raw material used. By effectively sorting and cleaning the raw material, the amount and size of slag inclusions can be reduced considerably (Williams, 2012, p. 74). Besides, wrought or bloomery iron does not seem to be too bad a material as Williams (2012) himself states that “wrought iron remained a favoured material of civil engineers until late in the 19th century on account of its ‘toughness’ (defined in this case as resistance to sudden shocks)”(p. 13). And sudden shocks are to be expected in the use of a sword blade. Furthermore, he gives the results of tensile testing carried out on the material of six franciscas (fifth to sixth century) which probably were of a very low carbon content. The material shows a very high ductility, higher than that of modern low‐carbon steels, thus not being brittle but very tough (Williams, 2012, pp. 80–81).

Furthermore, Williams (2012) states that the swords in his groups I and II were made of crucible steel that had been imported from Asia by Scandinavian merchants (pp. 61–62, 117). This is mainly based on his samples having a carbon content of >0.8% with very few or no slag inclusions and no traces of forge welding.

Two of the VLFBERHT swords the author of the article at hand has examined have been analysed by Williams.8 Due to the results, Williams classified them in his group I, together with a third sword,9 which had been analysed earlier and found also to have a carbon content >0.8%. But a visual examination of the first two blades showed welding seams on the surface of the blade (Figures 4 and 5). These swords have been made from a material with a layered or fibrous structure. In the case of the third sword, the drawing and the photographs published by Müller‐Wille (1977, cat. nr. 79, figures 13.6, 17.2) clearly show several evenly distributed groups of elongated structures running parallel to the axis of the blade. These are most probably also welding seams indicating a layered or fibrous structure. On four VLFBERHT swords from the Museum für Vor‐ und Frühgeschichte, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Petri, 2017, pp. 142–143, 147, 145–155, 163, 168) it could be confirmed by X‐ray images and microcomputer tomographies that these surface structures are in fact welding seams from the folding of the raw material.

This layered or fibrous structure is typical for all European iron or steel up to the invention of cast steel in the middle of the 18th century, resulting from the cleaning and homogenising of the raw material by folding and/or faggoting/piling. In the bloomery furnaces used for iron production, the iron was not molten during the process. It accumulated at the bottom of the furnace forming a bloom, which is an inhomogeneous spongy iron lump containing cavities and slag inclusions and slag adherent to its surface. The carbon content of a bloom was very inhomogeneous,it contained areas of medium and even high carbon contents, some small parts of it even being of cast iron, while the biggest part was almost carbon‐free iron (Pleiner, 2000, pp. 230–250, figure 66; Buchwald, 2008, p. 127, figure 110;Williams, 2012, p. 15.). After finishing the smelting process, the bloom was heated and hammered to remove remaining impurities and to consolidate it. To further clean and homogenise the material, it had to be drawn out and folded and forge welded several times. During this process, some of the slag was squeezed out at the edges and the remaining slag was broken up into smaller pieces. There was also the possibility to break the bloom into pieces and to separate the different material qualities according to their hardness, colour and/or structure. The sorted small pieces of similar material quality are than faggoted/piled and forge welded to give a bigger ingot (Buchwald, 2008, pp. 456–458; Mäder, 2009, pp. 68, 93–107, 140–141, 150, 154–158; Pleiner, 2000, pp. 215–216, 215–229, figure 51; Williams,2012, pp. 16, 24, 42; Föll (without date a), chapter 3.2.3; Föll (without date b). As a consequence of that process,already the raw material consisted of several more or less homogeneous layers, resulting in a layered or fibrous structure, depending on how the folding was done.

If the swords were made from crucible steel, they would not show welding seams. As crucible steel completely melts during its production, the metal completely separated from the slag and a homogeneous steel was achieved that does not need further cleaning and homogenising (Egerton of Tatton, 2002, pp. 58–59; Williams, 2012, pp.24–32.). Ideally, a sword from crucible steel would be made out of only one ingot.

How can these contradictory results be explained? As material faults like imperfect forge welds are more easily attacked by corrosion because they offer the possibility for the corrosion to penetrate the object, what is preserved today are the homogeneous or better ‐welded areas between them. So taking only very small metallographic samples bears the danger of sampling only the homogeneous areas or those with properly executed welding seams. Generally speaking, the smaller the sample, the more limited is the information about the composition of the sampled object. This is crucial, as most mediaeval sword blades are far from homogenous (Mäder, 2009, p. 14; Williams,2012, pp. 49–50.). For an identification of blades belonging to Williams' groups, a half section or at least a sample from the edge and one from the core would be necessary.

Williams' analyses of these swords have most probably been carried out on very small samples; unfortunately,neither the size of the samples nor the exact location of sampling are given in his publication. The depicted areas,however, are very small: The depicted sample from Solingen (Deutsches Klingenmuseum Solingen, 1973.W.005) measures about 0.3 × 0.37 mm, the one from Hamburg (Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte/Hamburg‐Museum,1965:124) about 0.08 × 0.08 mm. In the case of Hamburg (Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte/Hamburg‐Museum, M 1152), the sword has only been added to this group because of its high carbon content. This does not necessarily need to be crucible steel, as high‐carbon steels could also be produced in Europe. For example, the sword from Essen (Williams, 2012, p. 233) shows a carbon content of 1.1%, while the ore for the production originates from Loraine (FR) and the X‐ray images show clear welding seams indicating a layered or fibrous structure (Pothmann,1995, p. 3; Westphal, 1995, p. 65, figure 23, p. 68 figure 26). Williams himself gives several examples of steels with carbon contents of around 0.8% or even more from earlier periods without assuming that they have been made from crucible steel.10 Pleiner (2000, pp. 137, 190–191) demonstrated in an experiment that it was possible to manipulate the bloom in a certain way during the smelt, resulting in a better separation from slag and a high carbon content. The product was a hard, homogeneous carbon steel of nearly eutectoid composition. He assumes that there were individual groups of ironmakers who understood how to make such steeled blooms.

A low amount of slag in high‐carbon steels does also not necessarily point to a crucible steel, as in bloomery steels the amount of entrapped slag depends upon the carbon content—the more carbon, the less slag (Williams,2012, pp. 199, 202). Hardly visible traces of welding seams or even their absence in the metallographic section,although there are other indications for forge welding, have been stated for several swords analysed by Williams(Williams, 2012, pp. 54, 67, 149, 172, 173, 176, 181). Evidently, the forge welding had been carried out with high skill. This most probably also applies to the VLFBERHT swords under discussion.

So what remains of Williams´ study? With all due caution, some conclusions can be drawn from the results of his analysis. The VLFBERHT blades with Stalsbergs' inscription variant 1 contain high‐carbon steels, maybe they are even completely made of that material. In contrast, the VLFBERHT blades with Stalsbergs' inscription variant 2 are of steel with a lower carbon content that has been hardened, maybe with a core from iron. So these two inscription variants either mark two different workshops or two different methods of manufacture. These swords are of a relatively high quality and probably are the originals. The swords with misspelled signatures show heterogeneous methods of manufacture and predominately also a lower quality. These are most probably imitations or falsifications.

6 | CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE

The VLFBERHT swords have been studied for 130 years now. Thanks to their ever‐increasing number, Stalsberg was able to establish a typology of inscriptions and marks and to get results about their chronology and geographical distribution while Williams' analyses allow for a rating of the quality of the blades and the distinction between different manufacturing techniques as well as between originals and imitations or falsifications. Nevertheless, several questions remain unanswered.

To get a broader basis for typological studies of chronology and geographical distribution, more blades need to be checked for inscriptions. This is of course an enormous task. Stalsberg (2008a, p. 90; 2008b, p. 2) estimates that in Norway alone at least two and a half thousand double edged blades have to be examined.

To come closer to Ulfberht himself, more written sources have to be checked for his name, its components, and their various spellings as well as for the use of crosses in connection to names or, especially two crosses (Stalsberg, 2008a, p. 101; Stalsberg, 2008b, p. 17).

The reverse marks have been neglected so far. They should be further studied. Comparable motives might be found in other sources like for example images or architectural details (Stalsberg, 2008a, pp. 103–104, Stalsberg, 2008b, p. 20). Furthermore, their chronological and geographical development before, during, and after the time of VLFBERHT swords should be studied.

Last but not least, the manufacturing techniques have to be studied on a broader basis. This can be done for example by visual examinations of surface structures, X‐ray images, computer tomography, metallography, and studies about characteristics and provenance of the raw material. In this field, there has been a strong methodical development within the past years, the precision is increasing while at the same time sample sizes are getting smaller.Furthermore, analyses got faster and less complicated. So hopefully there will be plenty of new possibilities and results in the near future.

ENDNOTES

1 Marek suspects that the linguistic studies indicating the Frankish origin of the name where distorted in archaeological literature. The Artikel of Müller (1970) does not occur in his bibliography. Furthermore, he doubts that VLFBERHT is the name of a smith or producer of swords, because the signature never occurs in connection with “me fecit.”

2“Quae spata primum vagina, secundo corio qualicumque, tercio lintheamine candidissimo cera lucidissima roborato ita cingebatur, ut per medium cruciculis eminentibus ad peremptionem gentilium duraretur.” (Notker der Stammler, Liber I, 34). The author has to thank Roland Warzecha for pointing him to that source.

3The assignment of the swords to these groups is sometimes inconsequently and hard to follow. Williams (2012, pp. 169–170) may serve as an example: Only one small sample has been taken from sword IV.13 (Saaremaa K85‐123) the exact location of sampling not being given. Nevertheless, it has been assigned to group IV (“unhardened steel edges on an iron core”). For an identification of blades belonging to this group, a half section or at least a sample from the edge and one from the core would be necessary. Furthermore, the same sword is listed again on page 280 in group IV of the swords after 1000, even though in the text the dating “9th or 10th century” is given.

4Unfortunately, for 20 swords there are differences between the spelling of the inscription given in the list in Williams(2012, pp. 118–119) and in the respective text or only one possible spelling out of mostly two is given. The last two swords (V.11: p. 180 and V.12: pp. 180–182) are missing on the list.

AUTHOR BIOGRAPHY
Ingo Petri studied Prehistoric and Protohistoric Archaeology at the Christian‐Albrechts‐University in Kiel and the Adam‐Mickiewicz‐University in Poznań. At the moment, he is writing his PhD thesis on a case study about metal extraction and metalworking at the Slavic princely site Starigard/Oldenburg in Schleswig‐Holstein. Included in his thesis are metallographic analyses of knifes from that site. Besides this topic, Ingo Petri is also working on early mediaeval weapons, especially on development, manufacture, and use of swords and shields. At the moment,Ingo Petri is in charge of the Department of Museum Education at the Varusschlacht im Osnabrücker Land gGmbH ‐ Museum und Park Kalkriese.
